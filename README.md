A modern cross-platform GUI framework based on ImGui and GLFW, featuring Material Design 3 by default.

---

## Simple
Easy to use, yet powerful enough. The development experience is so logical and intuitive that it feels like second nature, while effortlessly handling incredibly complex workloads.

## High Performance
Fully powered by native C++ 20. It launches instantly on double-click, features a minimal memory footprint, and is extremely performance-friendly.

## Ultra Small
Outputs a **single executable file** by default via static linking—no need to bundle any dynamic libraries (DLLs/SOs). Built with the leanest possible dependencies, and Release binaries are compressed with [UPX](https://github.com/upx/upx) to achieve the absolute minimum footprint.

## Modern
A meticulously built top-level architecture designed for modern GUI software development. Out of the box, it fixes and natively supports IME (Input Method Editor).

## Highly Customizable
Design your own components however you wish using OpenGL 3.3 Core and ImGui APIs, then use them just like native ImGui widgets. It is ***stupidly easy and fast*** to build complex and beautiful UIs. Additionally, a visual UI editor is on the roadmap.

## Hybrid Mode
Neither Immediate Mode nor Retained Mode—but ***both***. CMaterial leverages Retained Mode at the **UI Layer** for the structural integrity of a mature framework, while empowering the **Component Layer** with Immediate Mode for unrestricted control over how every pixel is rendered.
